# pacman
This is a game very simular to the Pacman game.    
The game is coded with java gui and uses, many frames and panels, multy threads, timer, and two levels.  
The player is the small black circle (thick blue arow pointing at it), and the 4 ghosts are a small collored square ( thin black arow pointing at it).  
The goal of the game is to get all the dots (points), without getting caught by the Ghosts, or the time finishing (5 min).  
To move you need to press an arow button, and you will move in the direction of the arrow as long ist on the yellow path. The ghosts will be floting around and if you get cought by them, you loose, but you could always play again. if you get all the dots you win the game!!
